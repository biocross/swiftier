Hello there, I'm Siddharth! I work as an iOS engineer at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/). I love to focus on code performance, and often create tools to improve developer productivity. 

I've created Swift<span style='color: rgba(212,73,80,.85)'>ier</span> as a space to share what I've learnt about tuning and improving your code to optimize your app's performance. 

A lot of interesting posts are lined up, including a multistep guide to *improving your app's startup performance*, improving *compilation times*, and open sourcing of a lot of tools I've created! If you'd like to know when I post new articles, [subscribe to Swiftier](http://eepurl.com/gGV741)!

Thanks for reading!
